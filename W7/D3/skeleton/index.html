<!-- Warmup





Say cheese


Let's get some cat pictures on the screen. Create a new div with class 'image-1-container' and give it a fixed width of 200px and a fixed height of 600px. Also give it a colored background so we can actually see it (you get to pick the color this time). Inside of this new div, create an img tag that points to the file called cat.jpg that's in the assets folder.
Note that the image spills out of the div. By default, images will want to render with the full glorious dimensions. How can we combat this brash egotism? Tell the image to obey the constraints of its container by giving it a width of 100%. NB: You may be wondering, "100% of what". From the results of this experiment, you should be able to infer that width percentages are determined by the width of one's parent.

Make a copy of your image-1-container and paste it below the original. Change this copy's class but give it the same styles as the original. Make sure that the new image is back to it's old image ways and bursting out of its container (If it's not, you weren't specific enough with your style rules for the last image and you should go fix them).
Alter the styling on this new container so that it's width still defaults to 200px but now it can grow to accomodate any image. Hint hint, it's something you used earlier to accomodate your other children. Remember that div elements are blocks and will take up the whole width of the window if you don't constrain them, so you might want to change them to inline-blocks or something. -->
